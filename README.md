# Enigma
a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication.
In this design of the Enigma machine, we have five gears, three gears can be selected and used each time.
In this design, each letter passes through three gears and reaches a reflector, and the opposite letter outputs it and enters the three gears again and displays the output.
At the end of each character entering the gears, the first gear rotates one time to avoid repeating letters, and after the first gear rotates 27 times, the second gear rotates once.
